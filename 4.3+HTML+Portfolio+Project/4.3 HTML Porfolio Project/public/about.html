<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Mohd Safwan Uddin, a 19-year-old Computer Science and Engineering undergrad. You'll usually find me buried in books or on the sports field, giving my all in both. I've got this drive for learning that just won't quit..</p>

<p>When it comes to CSE, I'm all in. Algorithms, programming languages, you name it—I thrive on the challenge. But it's not just about acing exams; I'm all about pushing boundaries, exploring new ideas, and diving deep into the world of technology.

  And then there's sports. Man, I live for that rush. Whether it's sprinting on the track or strategizing on the court, I'm in my element. It's not just about winning; it's about the camaraderie, the teamwork, the sheer joy of pushing myself to the limit.</p>

<p>So yeah, that's me—Safwan Uddin, CSE enthusiast, sports fanatic, and perpetual learner. Ready to take on whatever life throws my way, one challenge at a time.</p>
